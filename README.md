# Let's be fit!

No Pain. No Gain... Or loss if you prefer to lose some extra kilos. This web application is dedicated to people who do not want to leave their weight and health to blind fate, but who intend to take matters into their own hands.

## About application

This web application is currently in Alpha version. There are still some remaining features to be implemented. It is my original, final project, which I had to defend by fulfilling requirements established in inner policy by [Coderslab](https://coderslab.pl/pl/) in order to obtain dimploma of completion of the course.

At current stage user can register an account, log into the system and provide his data like datebirth, current weight, target date to lose or gain his/her weight etc. The application will calculate user's BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) and approximete date of achiving the target provided by the user.

Here are the following technologies used in the project:
> - Spring Boot
> - Hibernate
> - Thymeleaf
> - JQPL and native SQL queries
> - webpage layout from [W3Layouts](https://w3layouts.com/) - HTML, CSS, JS
> - Spring Security
> - Dependency Injection
> - Import and use of external libraries like Lombok.
